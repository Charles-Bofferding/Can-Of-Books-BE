===Logistical===
What hours will you be available to communicate?
	9 am to 5 pm, but make sure to give time for lunch.
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
	Zoom if the room is open, slack, or the heroku virtual classroom
How often will you take breaks?
	As bodily functions or children require. At the minimum a fifteen every two hours.
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
	Ask the TAs or help and allocate more time to labs.

===Cooperative===
Make a list of each person’s strengths.
	Carlos: Front end magic and a sunny disposition. Chaz: Back end technical details and finding the problems in things
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
	We can collaborate to bring our individual strengths to help support each other.
In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
	We both want to further our technical knowledge in ways that will provide us with insights into industry standard practices
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
	We will collaborate regularily to make sure that all team members are aware of what the other is doing.

===Conflict Resolution===
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
	We will re-asses work distribution and make sure that clear goals and deadlines are being set.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
	The member feeling that they are being overtaken will communicate to the other their concerns. If the problem persists they will approach Jacob to act as a mediator.
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
	We will approach this project as a team exercise as a way for both of us to lift the other up and collaborate together.
